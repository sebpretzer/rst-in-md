        This method will look for fenced code blocks in markdown that are marked as
        restructured text (`rst`, `rest`, `restructuredtext`) and convert them to html.
        It leverages the same regex as the [FencedBlockPreprocessor](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/blob/33359faa385f59b84cd87df5f4b0996055a482e2/markdown/extensions/fenced_code.py#L56-L67)
        to find the blocks.

        You can also add an ignore comment right before the fenced block to prevent it
        from being converted. The comment should be `<!-- ignore: rst-in-md -->`. You
        can see an example of this [here](../../guides/inline_ignore/).

        Args:
            lines (list[str]): List of lines in markdown.

        Returns:
            list[str]: List of lines in markdown with rst replaced with html.
